# Changes

For use in the FRC Discord, we want the bot to be able to proxy everything as if it were in another server
while keeping all activity in a separate server.

In addition, switching replies to function more like the existing bot (where a user must use m!reply to trigger a message send)
would be ideal so that discussion amongst mods before replying to the user may occur.
UPDATE: This functionality is complete.

Honestly, these seem like the only changes for now. This is a solid foundation!
